# Hidden-Camera-Detector
This project is a machine learningâ€“powered application designed to detect hidden cameras in images and videos using both dataset-based training and real-time analysis. It uses computer vision techniques to identify visual cues such as bright circular glares, unusual reflections, and lens-like patterns.
